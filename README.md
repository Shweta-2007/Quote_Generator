# Quote_Generator

The JavaScript Quote Generator is a web application that provides users with inspirational and thought-provoking quotes from various famous individuals. This project aims to motivate and inspire users by presenting them with a new, meaningful quote each time they click the "New Quote" button.

Key Features:

Random Quote Generation: By clicking the "New Quote" button, users can fetch a random quote from a collection of inspirational quotes. The quotes are attributed to well-known figures such as Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey, Mahatma Gandhi, and others.

Author Attribution: Each quote is accompanied by the name of the person who said it, allowing users to recognize and appreciate the source of the wisdom.

Quote Collection: The project includes an array of quotes with associated author names. When the "New Quote" button is clicked, a random quote is selected from this collection and displayed.
